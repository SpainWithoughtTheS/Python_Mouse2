# Python_Mouse2
A lightweight Python automation tool that searches for an on-screen image and clicks it as fast as possible. Includes a built-in region capture tool (drag-to-save template), hotkeys for start/stop, and multi-scale OpenCV matching for high accuracy even with slight DPI or color differences.
